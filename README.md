# ECommerce
Build a simple e-commerce product listing page using the Fake
Store API. The application should showcase your front-end skills
and demonstrate a clean, user-friendly interface with the
requirement to use a tool or framework of your choice .

Fetch Data:
• Use the Fake Store API to fetch a list of products.
• Display the following information for each product:
◦ Product Image
◦ Title
◦ Price
◦ Rating
User Interface:
• Create a responsive layout using CSS Flex-box or Grid.
• Each product should be displayed in a card format with the
image, title, price, and rating.
• Include a loading indicator while data is being fetched.
• Implement basic error handling to display a message if the
data fetch fails.
Styling:
• Use CSS or a CSS framework (like Bootstrap or Tailwind)
for styling.
• Ensure the design is mobile-friendly and visually appealing.

• Source code hosted on a platform like GitHub.
• A live demo link (e.g., on Vercel, Netlify, or similar).
• A brief README file explaining your approach, any challenges
faced, and how to run the application locally.
